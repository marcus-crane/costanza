# Costanza

# What is this

A dumb app I made to play around with Vue Electron

# How do I use it?

Uhh, I mean, if you want, you can install it, run `npm install` and then

```
# to serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron app for production
npm run build

# run webpack in production
npm run pack
```

# I hate it

I know
